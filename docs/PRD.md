FlakeRadar PRD v1.0
Date: October 9, 2025
Version: 1.0
Owner: @rick1330
Status: Draft for Gate A Approval

1. Problem + Background
The Flaky Test Crisis
Flaky tests—tests that pass or fail inconsistently without code changes—are a critical pain point in modern software delivery. They create a cascade of problems:

Delivery Velocity Impact: Teams lose 2-8 hours per week investigating false failures, with 73% of engineering teams reporting flaky tests as a top CI/CD blocker
Release Confidence Erosion: Flaky tests mask real failures, leading to production incidents and reduced trust in test suites
Developer Productivity Loss: Context switching from feature work to test debugging fragments focus and increases cognitive load
CI Resource Waste: Unnecessary re-runs consume compute resources and extend feedback loops
CI Fragmentation Challenge
The modern CI landscape is fragmented across multiple platforms (GitHub Actions, CircleCI, Jenkins, GitLab CI) and testing frameworks (JUnit, Jest, PyTest, Mocha). Each combination has different:

Report formats and metadata structures
Retry semantics and failure classification
Integration patterns and webhook capabilities
Observability and debugging tools
Existing solutions are either:

Platform-specific (tied to single CI providers)
Enterprise-only (expensive, complex setup)
Framework-limited (support narrow test ecosystems)
Detection-only (identify problems without actionable remediation)
Market Gap
Teams need a CI-native, open-source solution that:

Works across popular CI platforms and test frameworks
Provides transparent, configurable flake detection algorithms
Offers actionable remediation guidance, not just alerts
Scales from small OSS projects to enterprise teams
Maintains privacy-by-design principles
2. Goals and Non-Goals
Goals (MVP Scope)
Primary Goal: Build an OSS, CI-native flaky test detection and remediation tool that teams love.

Specific MVP Goals:

Universal Ingestion: Accept test results from GitHub Actions (JUnit XML, Jest, PyTest) via simple API integration
Transparent Scoring: Compute flake scores using configurable heuristics (stability, volatility, recency, clustering)
Proactive Quarantine: Automatically comment on PRs and apply labels when flaky tests are detected
Actionable Insights: Provide dashboards showing flake trends and remediation playbooks with specific guidance
Non-Goals (MVP)
Heavy ML Models: No complex machine learning for flake prediction (keep algorithms transparent and explainable)
Deep Static Analysis: No language-specific AST analysis or code introspection
Multi-CI Support: Focus on GitHub Actions initially; expand to CircleCI, Jenkins later
Enterprise Features: No on-premise deployment, SOC 2 compliance, or advanced RBAC in MVP
Real-time Streaming: No complex event processing; batch ingestion is sufficient
Success Metrics
Adoption: 75+ GitHub stars and 10+ first-time contributors by Gate D
Functionality: Thin E2E flow (ingest → score → PR comment) working by Gate C
Quality: Zero a11y violations, <150KB bundle size, <2s ingest p95 latency
Community: 10+ good-first-issues and active Discussions by Gate D
3. Personas & Jobs-to-be-Done

Remediation playbooks with specific technical guidance
Site Reliability Engineer (Secondary)
Profile: Maintains CI/CD infrastructure and monitors system health JTBD: “Track test health metrics and reduce incident risk from flaky tests” Pain Points:

Limited observability into test suite stability trends
Flaky tests can mask real infrastructure issues
Difficulty correlating test failures with system changes
Key Needs:

Historical trend analysis and anomaly detection
Integration with existing monitoring and alerting systems
Ownership hints to route issues to appropriate teams
Developer (Secondary)
Profile: Individual contributor writing features and tests JTBD: “Get clear, actionable feedback on test issues in my PRs” Pain Points:

Uncertainty whether test failures are related to code changes
Lack of context on how to fix flaky tests
Interruption from investigating unrelated test failures
Key Needs:

  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  owner TEXT NOT NULL,
  default_branch TEXT DEFAULT 'main',
  visibility TEXT CHECK (visibility IN ('public', 'private')),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
TestCase
CREATE TABLE test_cases (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  repo_id INTEGER REFERENCES repos(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  path TEXT NOT NULL,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  framework TEXT CHECK (framework IN ('junit', 'jest', 'pytest')),
  tags TEXT[],
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(repo_id, path, name, framework)
);
TestRun
CREATE TABLE test_runs (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  test_case_id INTEGER REFERENCES test_cases(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  repo_id INTEGER REFERENCES repos(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  commit_sha TEXT NOT NULL,
  status TEXT CHECK (status IN ('pass', 'fail', 'skip')),
  duration_ms INTEGER,
  started_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),

);

CREATE INDEX idx_test_runs_repo_time ON test_runs(repo_id, started_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_test_runs_case_time ON test_runs(test_case_id, started_at DESC);

  window_n INTEGER NOT NULL,
  pass_rate FLOAT NOT NULL,
  volatility FLOAT NOT NULL,

  pattern TEXT NOT NULL, -- glob pattern like "src/auth/*"
  owner TEXT NOT NULL,   -- team or GitHub login
  source TEXT CHECK (source IN ('CODEOWNERS', 'manual')),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_owner_maps_repo_pattern ON owner_maps(repo_id, pattern);
Relationships & Constraints
Cascade Deletion: Repo deletion removes all associated data (TestCases, TestRuns, FlakeScores, OwnerMaps)
Retention Policy: TestRuns older than 30 days automatically purged; FlakeScores retained for 180 days
Unique Constraints: TestCase uniqueness prevents duplicates; FlakeScore one-per-TestCase ensures single source of truth
8. Telemetry & Privacy
Privacy-First Approach
FlakeRadar implements privacy-by-design with minimal data collection and user control:

Default State: All telemetry disabled in OSS installations Opt-in Required: Users must explicitly enable via FRA_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=true environment variable Transparent Disclosure: Clear privacy notice shown when enabling telemetry

Telemetry Events (When Enabled)
{
  "ui.page_view": {
    "route": "/dashboard",
    "timestamp": "2025-10-09T10:00:00Z",
    "session_id": "hashed_session"
  },
  "ingest.completed": {
    "framework": "junit",
    "test_count": 150,
    "payload_size_kb": 45,
    "processing_time_ms": 850,
    "repo_id_hash": "sha256_hash"
  },
  "scoring.candidates": {
    "total_tests": 150,
    "flaky_count": 3,
    "avg_score": 25.4
  }
}
Data Protection Measures
No PII: Never collect emails, real names, or IP addresses
Hashed Identifiers: Repo IDs hashed unless user explicitly opts into repo name sharing
DNT Respect: Honor Do-Not-Track headers by skipping all telemetry
Short Retention: Event data retained 30 days; only aggregate metrics kept longer
Easy Opt-out: Single environment variable to disable all collection
Compliance Alignment
GDPR Ready: Data minimization, purpose limitation, user control
CCPA Compliant: No sale of personal information, deletion rights
SOC 2 Foundation: Audit trails, access controls, incident response (for future hosted service)
