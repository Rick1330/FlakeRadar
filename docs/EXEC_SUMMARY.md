# Executive Summary

FlakeRadar is a CI-native flaky test detection and remediation platform for modern development teams. It helps engineering organizations reduce the time and cost associated with flaky tests by providing automated detection, transparent scoring, and actionable remediation guidance.

## Vision

Create a star-worthy open-source solution that helps teams detect, quarantine, and fix flaky tests with minimal overhead and maximum transparency.

## Key Features

1. **CI Integration**: Works with GitHub Actions, JUnit, Jest, PyTest and other popular test frameworks
2. **Flake Scoring**: Transparent heuristics to score test flakiness over time
3. **PR Quarantine Bot**: Automatically comments on and labels PRs with flaky tests
4. **Dashboards & Playbooks**: Provides insights and remediation guidance for test owners
5. **Privacy-First**: Collects minimal data and provides opt-in telemetry

## Architecture Overview

FlakeRadar follows a modular architecture:
- **Ingestion Layer**: Parses test results from various CI systems
- **Scoring Engine**: Applies transparent heuristics to identify flaky tests
- **PR Bot**: Integrates with GitHub to comment and label PRs
- **Dashboard**: Provides insights and remediation guidance
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL for structured data storage

## Quality Bars

- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.2 AA compliance
- **Performance**: Entry bundle <150KB gzipped
- **Security**: CSP, CodeQL, Dependabot protection
- **Privacy**: Minimal PII collection with opt-in telemetry

## Roadmap

The FlakeRadar roadmap is divided into four gates:
- **Gate A**: Program documentation and planning (Complete)
- **Gate B**: UI library and web application scaffolding
- **Gate C**: Monorepo implementation with thin E2E
- **Gate D**: Community launch with CLI and integrations

## Community Goals

- Friendly onboarding experience for new contributors
- Clear roadmap and well-labeled issues ("good first issue", "help wanted")
- Active Discussions forum for proposals and Q&A
- Transparent governance and release process

## Next Steps

With Gate A complete, the next phase involves:
1. Creating UI library and web application repositories
2. Implementing the ingestion and scoring engines
3. Building the PR quarantine bot
4. Developing dashboards and remediation playbooks
