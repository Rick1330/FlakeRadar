# Executive Summary — Gate A (FlakeRadar OSS)

What and Why
- FlakeRadar is an open-source, CI‑native flaky test detection and remediation tool. It ingests JUnit/Jest/PyTest results from GitHub Actions, scores flakiness with transparent heuristics, comments on PRs to quarantine flaky tests, and provides dashboards and playbooks to guide fixes.
- Purpose: showcase engineering craft, build community, and deliver a useful devtool that can evolve into a hosted offering.

Plan
- Gate A (Weeks 1–2): Discovery + PRD (docs only)
  - Deliverables: Charter, Execution Plan, Architecture Brief v0.1, Tool Playbook (prompts), Risk Register, Compliance Brief, Governance docs, Issue templates + seeds, Session Handoff.
  - Tools: Manus (research) and mgx.dev (PRD v1.0). Outputs will trigger v1.1 updates to Charter, Architecture, and Compliance with citations.
- Gate B (Weeks 3–8): Build @flakeradar/ui (a11y-first) and Next.js app Option A with CSP and budgets (entry <150KB gz).
- Gate C (Weeks 9–12): Scaffold monorepo (Nx) and ship a thin E2E: ingest → score → PR comment/label, CI green.
- Gate D (Weeks 13–16): Community launch with CLI, docs site, Slack/webhooks, and additional integrations.

Budgets (non‑negotiable)
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.2 AA; jest‑axe zero violations on polished pages.
- Performance: entry bundle <150KB gz; API GET p95 <150ms; ingest p95 <2s for 5MB.
- Security: CSP via next-safe-middleware; CodeQL weekly; Dependabot; protected main (ci + CodeQL, 1 review, linear history).
- Privacy: minimal PII; opt‑in telemetry; 30‑day default retention for TestRun; delete-by-repo supported.

Key Risks & Mitigations
- Signal quality across frameworks → rolling heuristics; golden test suite; explainable scores.
- PR bot spam/rate limits → idempotent single comment and write limits.
- OSS sustainability → good‑first‑issues, CONTRIBUTING, CODEOWNERS, Discussions; recruit co‑maintainers post Gate C.
- Data privacy → redact stack traces by default; store minimal PII; deletion endpoint.

What Happens After Gate A Approval
- Run Manus and mgx.dev using playbooks to generate Research Brief and PRD v1.0.
- Executors create code repos (ui/web), enable CI/protections, and start Gate B WUs.
- Orchestrator enforces budgets, maintains Build Log/ADRs, and prepares subtree plan for Gate C.

Assumptions to Validate
- Node 20, pnpm; Postgres hosted (Neon/Supabase) for dev; telemetry disabled by default; GitHub App minimal permissions for PR bot.
