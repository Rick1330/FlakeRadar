# Architecture Decision Records (ADR) — Index

How we document decisions:
- For any material decision (architecture, quality bars, governance, privacy), create an ADR in adr/ using adr/template.md.
- Update this index with: Number • Title • Status • Date.

Planned initial ADRs (to be added in later packets):
- 0001 — Project name and scope ("FlakeRadar") • Proposed
- 0002 — Public OSS under Apache‑2.0 • Proposed
- 0003 — Standalone MVP; hosted add‑ons later • Proposed
