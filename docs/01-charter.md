# FlakeRadar — Program Charter (Gate A)

Purpose
- Build an OSS, CI‑native flaky test detection and remediation tool that teams love.
- Showcase engineering craft, community leadership, and product rigor.

Vision
- Every team ships faster because flaky tests are detected early, quarantined safely, and fixed with clear guidance.

Value Proposition
- CI‑native ingestion + transparent scoring + actionable remediation playbooks.
- OSS core for trust and extensibility; optional hosted dashboards later.

Personas
- Eng Managers: reduce CI waste, improve release reliability.
- QA/SET: identify and quarantine flaky tests, drive fixes.
- SRE: track test health, reduce incident risk.
- Developers: get PR‑level feedback and clear next steps.

Objectives & Key Results (Gate A → D overview)
- O1 (Gate A: Weeks 1–2) Foundation and PRD
  - KR1: Deliver Charter, Execution Plan, Architecture Brief outline, Tool Playbook, Risk/Compliance docs.
  - KR2: Produce PRD v1.0 via mgx.dev; approve Gate A.
  - KR3: Create ADRs 0001–0003 and index in DECISIONS.md.
- O2 (Gate B: Weeks 3–8) UI + App Scaffold
  - KR: @flakeradar/ui v0.1.0, Next.js app Option A with CI green; a11y/perf budgets enforced.
- O3 (Gate C: Weeks 9–12) Thin E2E
  - KR: ingest → score → quarantine comment flow on a sample repo; protected main stays green.
- O4 (Gate D: Weeks 13–16) Community Launch
  - KR: CONTRIBUTING, good‑first‑issues, docs site, CLI, integrations roadmap.

Scope (MVP)
- Ingest results from GitHub Actions (JUnit XML, Jest, PyTest).
- Compute flake scores over time (stability index, failure clustering, recency weighting).
- Quarantine bot: PR comments/labels and Slack/webhook alerts.
- Dashboards: test health trends, flaky tests list, ownership hints.
- Playbooks: suggested fixes with code pointers (recent edits/owners).

Non‑Goals (MVP)
- Heavy ML models for flake prediction.
- Deep static analysis or language‑specific AST tooling.
- Broad multi‑CI support beyond GitHub Actions (expand later).
- On‑prem enterprise features; SOC 2 certification (planned later).

Constraints & Principles
- OSS, public repo; license Apache‑2.0.
- Stack: TypeScript, Next.js/Node, Postgres, Tailwind, GitHub Actions.
- Region/laws: Global; privacy‑by‑design; minimal PII; GDPR aware; SOC 2 later.
- Team: solo + AI tools; chat‑only orchestration; executors handle git/CI.
- Resume‑safe WUs (15–45 min): commit + push + Build Log + ADR (if decision) + session state.

Quality Bars (non‑negotiable)
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.2 AA; jest‑axe zero violations on polished pages/components.
- Performance: entry bundle <150KB gzipped; route‑level code splitting; SSR‑friendly; Core Web Vitals tracked.
- Security: CSP via next-safe-middleware; no secrets in repo; .env.example only; CodeQL weekly; Dependabot enabled; protected main (require “ci” + CodeQL, 1 review, linear history); license scanning allowlist (Apache/MIT/BSD).
- Privacy: minimal PII; opt‑in telemetry with disclosure; retention defaults 30 days for anonymous usage logs [ASSUMPTION]; documented DPA stance for hosted later.

Governance (OSS)
- Model: Maintainer‑led with lazy consensus; founding maintainer @rick1330.
- Decision records: ADRs in adr/ (template provided); index in docs/DECISIONS.md.
- Community: CODE_OF_CONDUCT (Contributor Covenant v2.1), CONTRIBUTING (triage/labels/PR review), SECURITY (responsible disclosure).
- Releases: semantic versioning; release plan and MAINTAINERS/CODEOWNERS in Gate A; roadmap via Discussions + issues.

Success Metrics (leading indicators)
- Gate A approved by Week 2; PRD v1.0 published.
- Community scaffolding in place (labels, templates, Discussions).
- Execution readiness: playbooks for Manus/mgx/Lindy/Qoder/emergent.sh complete; CI protection policy drafted.

Risks (pointer; detailed in Risk Register)
- Signal quality across frameworks; privacy of logs; OSS sustainability; CI variability. Mitigations tracked in docs/05-risk-register.md.

Assumptions
- Node.js 20 LTS; pnpm; default branch “main”; Discussions enabled.
- Telemetry provider to be selected in Gate B (or skipped for OSS) [ASSUMPTION].

Gate A Deliverables (approval checklist)
- Charter (this doc), Execution Plan, Architecture Brief outline, Tool Playbook, Risk Register, Compliance Brief, initial ADRs, issue templates + seed, governance docs.
