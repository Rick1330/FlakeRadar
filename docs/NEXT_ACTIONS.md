# Next Actions

This document outlines the immediate next steps for continuing FlakeRadar development after Gate A completion.

## Immediate Priorities

1. **Run Manus and mgx.dev**
   - Execute the research playbook to refine the problem space
   - Use mgx.dev to produce PRD v1.0 with detailed requirements
   - Update docs/01-charter.md and docs/03-architecture-brief.md with findings

2. **Create UI/Web Repositories**
   - Create rick1330/flakeradar-ui for the UI component library
   - Create rick1330/flakeradar-web for the web application
   - Apply branch protections and CI workflows as documented in the tool playbook

3. **Set Up Project Infrastructure**
   - Ensure a GitHub Project board titled "FlakeRadar Roadmap" exists
   - Add GH_TOKEN_SEED secret with repo and project scopes for cross-repo writes
   - Verify all issues from seed.json are properly created and mapped

## Gate B Execution

Begin work on the Gate B epics and stories:
- EP-002: Gate B - UI library v0.1.0 + Web app Option A
- Associated stories (ST-101 through ST-104)

Follow the WU cadence:
- 15-45 minute resume-safe work units
- Each WU ends with a commit, push, and BUILDLOG.md update
- Create ADRs for significant decisions

## Quality Assurance

- Verify all quality bars are enforced:
  - Accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA)
  - Performance (entry bundle <150KB gzipped)
  - Security (CSP, CodeQL, Dependabot)
  - Privacy (minimal PII collection)

## Community Setup

- Enable GitHub Discussions for the repository
- Create and curate "good first issue" and "help wanted" labels
- Set up the governance model as defined in GOVERNANCE.md

## Documentation Updates

- Update docs/01-charter.md with PRD v1.0 content
- Revise docs/03-architecture-brief.md with detailed technical specifications
- Create ADRs 0001-0003 as planned in the execution packet

## Executors

The next executor should:
1. Review all created issues and understand the roadmap
2. Begin work on Gate B items using either Qoder/Cursor or emergent.sh
3. Follow the established patterns for commits, documentation, and ADRs
4. Maintain the WU cadence and update BUILDLOG.md with each completed unit
