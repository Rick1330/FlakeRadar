2025-10-08 • WU‑001 • rick1330/flakeradar-program • Initialize program repo skeleton
- What/Why
  - Created Gate A program repo structure for FlakeRadar (OSS). Seeded README, license, ignore rules, Build Log, ADR index, and session state to enable resume‑safe execution.
- Artifacts/Links
  - Files: README.md, LICENSE, .gitignore, docs/BUILDLOG.md, docs/DECISIONS.md, docs/SESSION_STATE.json
- Follow‑ups
  - Next WUs: WU‑002 Charter; WU‑003 Governance [ASSUMPTION: Execution Plan will be delivered as WU‑003 per packet plan]

2025-10-08 • WU‑002 • rick1330/flakeradar-program • Add Program Charter (vision, OKRs, constraints, governance, quality bars)
- What/Why
  - Captured scope and non‑goals for the MVP; set quality/security/privacy budgets; defined OSS governance and Gate A approval checklist to guide subsequent execution.
- Artifacts/Links
  - Added: docs/01-charter.md

2025-10-08 • WU‑003 • rick1330/flakeradar-program • Add Execution Plan (WUs, gates, kickoff, RACI, subtree, community milestones)
- What/Why
  - Established resume‑safe WU map across Gates A–D; defined 10‑day kickoff, roles (RACI), repo/subtree plan, and community milestones to guide a predictable OSS delivery.
