2025-10-08 • WU‑001 • rick1330/flakeradar-program • Initialize program repo skeleton
- What/Why
  - Created Gate A program repo structure for FlakeRadar (OSS). Seeded README, license, ignore rules, Build Log, ADR index, and session state to enable resume‑safe execution.
- Artifacts/Links
  - Files: README.md, LICENSE, .gitignore, docs/BUILDLOG.md, docs/DECISIONS.md, docs/SESSION_STATE.json
  - Decisions: none (ADR index only)
- Follow‑ups
  - Next WUs: WU‑002 Charter; WU‑003 Governance [ASSUMPTION: Execution Plan will be delivered as WU‑003 per packet plan]

2025-10-08 • WU‑002 • rick1330/flakeradar-program • Add Program Charter (vision, OKRs, constraints, governance, quality bars)
- What/Why
  - Captured scope and non‑goals for the MVP; set quality/security/privacy budgets; defined OSS governance and Gate A approval checklist to guide subsequent execution.
- Artifacts/Links
  - Added: docs/01-charter.md
- Follow‑ups
  - Align next WU naming with packet plan: WU‑003 will be Execution Plan (was “Governance” in seed) [ASSUMPTION]
  - Draft ADRs 0001–0003 alongside Execution Plan

  2025-10-08 • WU‑003 • rick1330/flakeradar-program • Add Execution Plan (WUs, gates, kickoff, RACI, subtree, community milestones)
- What/Why
  - Established resume‑safe WU map across Gates A–D; defined 10‑day kickoff, roles (RACI), repo/subtree plan, and community milestones to guide a predictable OSS delivery.
- Artifacts/Links
  - Added: docs/02-execution-plan.md
- Follow‑ups
  - Proceed to WU‑004: Architecture Brief v0.1
  - Prepare ADRs 0001–0003 in upcoming packets

  2025-10-08 • WU‑004 • rick1330/flakeradar-program • Architecture Brief v0.1 (C4, ingestion, scoring, PR bot, ER model, budgets)
- What/Why
  - Outlined a pragmatic container model using Next.js API routes, a TS parser/scorer, Postgres storage, and a minimal GitHub App for PR comments/labels. Established ingestion/API contracts, scoring formula v0.1, ER model, and privacy/security budgets to enable Gate C thin E2E.
- Artifacts/Links
  - Added: docs/03-architecture-brief.md
- Follow‑ups
  - Draft ADRs: 0001 project name/scope; 0002 OSS license; 0003 standalone MVP hosted later
  - Proceed to WU‑005: Tool Playbook (prompts)
