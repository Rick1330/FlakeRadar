2025-10-08 • WU‑001 • rick1330/flakeradar-program • Initialize program repo skeleton
- What/Why
  - Created Gate A program repo structure for FlakeRadar (OSS). Seeded README, license, ignore rules, Build Log, ADR index, and session state to enable resume‑safe execution.
- Artifacts/Links
  - Files: README.md, LICENSE, .gitignore, docs/BUILDLOG.md, docs/DECISIONS.md, docs/SESSION_STATE.json
  - Decisions: none (ADR index only)
- Follow‑ups
  - Next WUs: WU‑002 Charter; WU‑003 Governance [ASSUMPTION: Execution Plan will be delivered as WU‑003 per packet plan]

2025-10-08 • WU‑002 • rick1330/flakeradar-program • Add Program Charter (vision, OKRs, constraints, governance, quality bars)
- What/Why
  - Captured scope and non‑goals for the MVP; set quality/security/privacy budgets; defined OSS governance and Gate A approval checklist to guide subsequent execution.
- Artifacts/Links
  - Added: docs/01-charter.md
- Follow‑ups
  - Align next WU naming with packet plan: WU‑003 will be Execution Plan (was “Governance” in seed) [ASSUMPTION]
  - Draft ADRs 0001–0003 alongside Execution Plan
